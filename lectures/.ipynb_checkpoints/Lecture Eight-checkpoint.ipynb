    "We've worked with a few algorithms a lot.  Now we'll introduce a new data structure - the matrix.  A matrix mathematically speaking is a notational convention.  More or less a matrix is just a vector of vectors.  And a vector is just the coefficients of a linear equation.  We've been implicitly using mathematical vectors since we introduced equations in lecture three.  To remind you, let's look at some python code, representing a vector:"

    "The above code should appear familiar because it's the same code we saw in lecture 3.  Notice the list we pass in to `find_zero_eq`.  These different lists are all mathematical vectors, because they represent the coeficients of an equation.  A matrix is a similar idea, except instead of having a system depend on only one equation, it depends on multiple.  Let's see a simple example of this before we formalize the notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "## A first example of matrices, Supply and Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we own and operate a business that sells candy bars.  Assume there is implicit demand for candy bars and many other candy bar sellers.  However, assume our costs are perhaps slightly different from other candy bar sellers, so we can choose what price to sell our candy bar at, subject to our ability to supply candy.  We can also assume we have some supply control because most people aren't patient about candy, they want it when they want it.  So if someone happens by your shop, the price may actually effect their decision to buy the candy or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's say you have a supply function like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`price = 2*quantity + 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "What this equation says is as a business owner, as the price increases you'll want to supply more candy bars, because the perception is, you'll make more money.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also say there is a demand function like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`price = 3 - 2*quantity`\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation says the price you can charge is subject to how many candy bars you make.  So if your shop is filled to the brim and your the only local vendor around, folks will likely be able to always satisfy their craving for candy.  And if you only make a single candy bar, folks will be willing to pay a lot to be the only one to get it.  Because candy is delicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above equations we need both the supply and demand equation to find the unique equilibrium of price and quantity such that the market for candy bars is in balance.  This balancing point, all other things held constant, will be the price that maximizes utility for the buyers of candy bars as well as the sellers of candy bars.  And since we are treating our example as idealized, we are in a capitalism regime where the intention is to maximize utility for all.  However, even with the introduction of immorality and therefore businesses or agents acting in subversive ways, all economies are still subject to the above laws generally speaking and therefore understanding this idealized situation still yields value.\n",
    "\n",
    "So!  Now that we have our supply and demand equations, how do we find the unique price, quantity that yields our equilibrium?  With matrices of course!\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll need to turn these equations into the appropriate form:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supply:\n",
    "\n",
    "`price - 2*quantity = 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "Demand:\n",
    "\n",
    "`price + 2*quantity = 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to do this so all the variables are on one side of the equation.  Now we can do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supply/Demand Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1 -2][[3]\n",
    "[1  2]][3]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have the two resulting mathematical objects, a matrix describing the coeficients of the two equations and a vector describing the solution space.  We'll do something called row reduction on the matrix which will produce unique solutions for the equations.  Before we carry out these operations notice that if our matrix looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1 0][[a\n",
    "[0  1]][b]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then whatever our variables are, they are equal to a and b respectively.  Because the matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1 0]\n",
    "[0  1]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Translates to\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x \n",
    "y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `[a b]` vector this becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = a\n",
    "y = b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which solves x and y uniquely!  So now we'll do row reduction to create a matrix which looks like the above one.  And then we'll apply the changes we used on the matrix, onto the solution vector as well.  Which will in turn solve our system of equations!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1 -2]  R[1] = R[1] + R[2]  [[2  0]    R[1] = R[1]/2   [[1  0]   R[2] = R[2] - R[1]  [[1  0]  R[2] = R[2]/2\n",
    "[1  2]]  ----------------->  [1   2]]   ------------->  [1   2]]  ----------------->   [0  2]] ------------>\n",
    "\n",
    "[[1  0]\n",
    " [0  1]]\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    "Now we'll simply apply the changes to the matrix to the vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[3]  R[1] = R[1] + R[2]  [[6]   R[1] = R[1]/2   [[3]   R[2] = R[2] - R[1] [[3]  R[2] = R[2]/2  [[3]\n",
    "[3]]  ----------------->   [3]]  ------------->   [3]]  -----------------> [0]]  ------------>   [0]]\n",
    "\n",
    "So the unique solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "price = 3\n",
    "quantity = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this ends up telling us is it's not possible to optimally operate our candy bar shop.  Which is pretty sad.  So this means we shouldn't open our candy bar shop.  Or we need to change our supply equation by becoming more efficient at producing candy bars.  Of course, it could also be the case that this is truly optimal because candy is bad for you :P.  But that's not really an economic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any event, we are now ready to write a program which does row reduction for us, by solving a bunch of very simple equations.  Notice, what we really want is to make the numbers in the matrix that are not on the diagonal zero.  And then we want to make the numbers that are on the diagonal 1.  And then we need to store those operations and apply them to solution matrix.\n"
