    "........self.[PARAMETER 1] = [PARAMETER 1]\n",

    "....def [Method Name](self, [PARAMETER 1], ...[PARAMETER N]):\n",
    "........indented code goes here\n",
    "...\n",
    "........return (optionally)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see all class functions, called methods require the first position to be something called `self`.  The `self` keyword gets replaced at instantiation time with the instatiated class name.  In our above example it is `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `self` can be thought of as a placeholder for whatever name we decide to give our instatiated class.  This allows us to treat a class kind of like a template for other code that is intended to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a little bit rigirous here, a class is defined as a collection of data and functions (known as methods), that can interact with each other, but may not be able to interact with the larger code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "More or less, classes are another way of seperating (at least in principle) what your code can augment as well as the code of others.  In a way, classes are kind of like another level of scoping rules, the same way we had local scope and global scope.  Now we also have code that runs inside our classes and outside our classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the class above and in all classes, there is a special method called a constructor.  In Python it is denoted by the name `__init__` and it is what tells Python how to instiate the Python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "When in the above code we called `a = A(5)` we were calling the `__init__` method we defined in the class above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, notice that we can interact directly with the variables associated with our class, simply by accessing the variable via `.` - this is refered to as dot notation and is extremely flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "With dot notation we need not concern ourselves with being nearly as original.  Say you want two functions called add that mean two completely different things, depending on context.  Now you can freely define those two different add methods!  Just define them in two seperate classes.\n",
    "\n",
